# DeepSulfation (in progress)

1- Collection of all the verified sulfation sites of human proteins from UniProt, and then pre-process them by removing redundancy. 

3 - Attempting to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (embeddings) by using the language model ELMo taken from natural language processing.

4 - Evaluate the predication performance and compare it to the other known methods.

5 - Deploying the model in the web using Streamlit and AWS.
